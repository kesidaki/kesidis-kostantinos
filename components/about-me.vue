        <p>Hello. My name is Konstantinos Kesidis and i work as a web developer</p>
        <p>I started developing as a hobby and it almost immediatelly became my career of choice. What i love most about my job is the ability to design and create beautiful websites depending on the content they provide. Gaining the skills and knowledge required to create functional applications that will satisfy both my and my clients need.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">I always try to learn something new and work on improving my already existing knowledge, so that i can deliver better and better results. Technology and the digital world does not stand still and i believe that neither should i. This is also part of what i love about my job, there is always something to learn and many new ways to improve.</p>
